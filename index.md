**Flood risk prediction toolüèòÔ∏è**
<br>
Flooding is a pressing issue and may occur after heavy rainfall, being exacerbated by recurring events. This research identified areas of England that are at risk of flooding through a prediction model. We created  a model with the capability to classify flood risk for UK postcodes and locations and to visualise and analyse rainfall data in conjunction with the above tool to present risk information to the user.

[Undergraduate Dissertation : From discourses to emotions: A Twitter data-driven study of environmental worry using deep neural networks.](/pdf/undergrad_diss.pdf)
<br>
My final-year dissertation aimed to investigate the discourses surrounding the climate crisis and its emotions, adopting an interdisciplinary approach that integrated sentiment analysis to offer deeper insights into climate psychology. A Twitter dataset containing over 40,000 English-written tweets, collected over four months, was pre-processed for this study. Employing the Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM), this study analyzed interpersonal expressions related to climate change, with a particular focus on negative emotive content.

The results of this investigation indicated that environmental worry was the most prevalent form of emotion expressed on Twitter about climate change, encompassing a range of multifaceted expressions. Additionally, the vocabulary used in tweets containing negative or positive emotional content differed significantly. Consequently, this research offered valuable insights into developing effective online communication strategies to inspire pro-climate action.

**Sustainachain üåø - Hackathon-W3B London 2024 (Bronze)ü•â**
<br>
In April 2024, I participated in my first hackathon, collaborating with a team of students I had never met before. Over the course of two intense days, we developed the source code for an MVP called Sustainachain, leveraging Tezos blockchain technology. Sustainachain is designed to enhance traceability and transparency for food retailers, helping them differentiate themselves by restoring consumer trust. The tool empowers customers to make informed choices by allowing them to trace organic products from farm to supermarket using secure codes, preventing fraud and ensuring the integrity of organic certifications. As someone new to blockchain and cryptocurrency, this experience was an invaluable opportunity to learn both the fundamentals of blockchain technology and the process of creating a viable business model.

**Can inflammatory negative sentiment predict in-degree centrality in online social networks? A Reddit data analysis**
<br>
This project investigated whether inflammatory negative sentiment predict in-degree centrality in online social networks. Using a sample of 5 submissions on r/UmbrellaAcademy, discourse around Elliot Page coming out as a transgender man was scored using sentiment analysis. The extracted data was used to construct a network of comments, and the in-degree centrality of each node was compared to inflammatory negative sentiment using multiple regression with time fixed effects. The results suggest that inflammatory negative sentiment does not have a strong positive effect on centrality, but instead a weak positive one.
